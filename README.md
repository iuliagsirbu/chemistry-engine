# Chemistry Engine

## Description
The purpose of this project
is to simulate simple and/or 
more elaborate chemical reactions using 
C++ and Object-oriented Programming
principles.

## Features implemented
So far the features are:

- Element class
    - can add, modify and display
elements
    - can add and display isotopes
    - can verify if two elements are the same or not
    - can copy elements
    - can be verified using asserts

- Compound class
    - can add, modify and display
      compounds based on existing or new elements
    - can calculate the mass of the compound
    - can deduce the formula
    - can return an array with the number of distinct elements
    - can copy compounds
    - can be verified using asserts

- Reaction class
    - can add, modify and display reactions
    - can copy reactions
    - can display a balanced reaction of type: A + B -> C
